## about the project:
Star-app-react is  areact version of [this project](https://github.com/kamilkazor/star-app-vue) originally made in vue.

The app utilizes react-router for navigation, zustand as a simple store
and react-query for handling communication with the [SWAPI API](https://swapi.dev/).
The project also uses react-helmet-async for dynamic titles and zod for validation of API responses and form input.
For the styling, tailwind css was used. 
All the animations between routes and list elements originally made with the vue's built-in transition components
were recreated with the help of framer-motion library.
Finally, the app was tested with the help of vitest and react testing-library.
